Solution Description

buy_stocks(...) is the vulnerable function. The function statically loads the API key, meaning that it is stored on the stack.
The function then calls printf on a 300 byte string of user input. By inputting "%p" 150 times, the printf function will pop the stack
and print the last 150 stack slots. My solution uses Python socket programming to capture the printed stack. To find the flag, I pasted
the stack into a CyberChef recipe that accounts for endianness.
